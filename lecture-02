1. **Understanding the Problem**
    - Clearly define the project objectives.
    - Establish success metrics for the project.
    - Identify the type of problem (e.g., classification, regression).

2. **Gathering Relevant Data**
    - Collect data from multiple sources.
    - Ensure the data is pertinent to the problem at hand.
    - Consider the data's volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.

3. **Data Preparation & EDA**
    - Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
    - Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
    - Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into the data.
    - Prepare the data for accurate analysis.

4. **Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction**
    - Select the most relevant features.
    - Create new features to enhance model performance.
    - Reduce dimensionality if the feature space is too extensive.
    - Identify the most important features for modeling.

5. **Model Building & Deployment**
    - Choose suitable algorithms and train models.
    - Validate model performance through cross-validation.
    - Deploy the model for real-time application or batch processing.
    - Continuously monitor and refine the model as necessary.
